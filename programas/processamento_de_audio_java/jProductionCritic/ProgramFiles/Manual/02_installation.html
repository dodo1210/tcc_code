<p><strong>EXPLANATION OF THIS SECTION</strong></p>
<p>This section of the manual describes how to access and 
    install jProductionCritic onto one's computer, and includes an outline of some of 
    the files and resources included with the jProductionCritic distribution package.</p>
<p> <strong>COMPATIBILITY</strong></p>
<p>This software is written in Java, which means that it can theoretically be run
  on any system that has the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on it. It 
  is recommended that this software be used with Windows, however, as it was 
  developed and tested under the Windows operating system, and the interface's 
  appearance was developed under Windows. Although the software should 
  theoretically run under OS X, Linux, Solaris or any other operating system with
  the JRE installed on it, users should be advised that the software has not yet 
  been fully tested on other platforms, so difficulties may be encountered.</p>
<p>This software was developed with version 7 of Java, so it is suggested that the corresponding version or higher of the JRE be
  installed on the user's computer.</p>
<p> <strong>INSTALLING THE JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT</strong></p>
<p>If your system already has the JRE installed, as will most typically be the 
  case, you may skip this section. If not, you will need to install the JRE in
  order to run this project. The JRE can be downloaded for free from the Java web
  site. The JDK typically includes the JRE, or the JRE can simply be installed
  alone.</p>
<p>When the JRE download is complete, follow the installation instructions that
  come with it in order to install it.</p>
<p> <strong>INSTALLING JPRODUCTIONCRITIC</strong></p>
<p>The project can be accessed at <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net" target=top>http://jmir.sourceforge.net</a>. This distribution 
  includes a pre-compiled Jar file, the source code and extensive documentation.
  All of this is delivered in a zipped file, from which the project files can be
  extracted.</p>
<p>There are two versions of the project, namely the developer version and the
  user version. The user version contains everything needed to run the project,
  but does not include any source code. The developer version does include
  source code, presented in the form of a NetBeans project.</p>
<p>The user version unzips into a single directory. Installation simply involves 
  copying this directory into any desired location.</p>
<p>The following directories are contained in the developer zip file:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>jProductionCritic:</strong> The jProductionCritic project, presented in the form of a NetBeans project.
    Contains the following directories and files:
    <ul>
      <li>dist: Contains a pre-compiled jProductionCritic.jar file (and associated
    	libraries) for direct inclusion in other projects.</li>
      <li>javadoc: Javadoc documentation for the project source code.</li>
      <li>lib: Code library settings used by the NetBeans IDE.</li>
      <li>Licenses: Licenses associated with the project and its dependencies.</li>
      <li>nbproject: NetBeans project files. This is only relevant to those
    	wishing to use the software in a NetBeans IDE context; it is certainly
    	possible to use the software in other development environments as well.</li>
      <li>ProgramFiles: Contains files used by the software.</li>
      <li>src: The project's source code.</li>
      <li>build.xml: NetBeans build instructions. Only relevant if using the
    	NetBeans IDE.</li>
      <li>jProductionCriticConfigs.jpc: A configuration settings file.</li>
      <li>    	 manifest.mf: The manifest used when building the project Jar file.</li>
      <li>Manual.html: The software's manual.</li>
      <li>README.txt: Basic overall documentation of the project.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Third_Party_Jars: </strong>Contains the distributable third-party software used by 
    the project. Also includes the jar files for other jMIR projects that this
    project has as adependencies. These need to be included in the jMusicMetaManager
    build (in the NetBeans context, this means adding the jar files found here as 
    libraries).</li>
</ul>
<p>Both the user and developer versions of jProductionCritic make use of a <a href="06_configuration_settings_file.html">configuration settings file</a>. A default configuration file called jProductionCriticConfigs.jpc is included with both the user and developer distributions, which the user may edit or replace. A new configuration with default settings is automatically generated by jProductionCritic if this file is deleted.</p>
<p><strong>RUNNING JPRODUCTIONCRITIC</strong></p>
<p>Once the installation instructions provided above have been completed, the 
  user may then run jProductionCritic. Instructions on how to run jProductionCritic are included 
  in the sections of the manual on the <a href="03_command_line_arguments.html">command line interface</a> and the <a href="04_graphical_user_interface.html">GUI</a>.</p>
