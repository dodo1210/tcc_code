<strong>Compatibility Issues</strong> 
<p>The jMusicMetaManager software is written in <a href="http://java.sun.com" target=top>Java</a>, 
  which means that it can theoretically be run on any system that has the Java 
  Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on it. It is recommended that this software 
  be used with Windows XP, however, as it was developed and tested under the Windows 
  XP operating system, and the interface&#8217;s appearance is optimized for Windows. 
  Although the software should theoretically run under earlier versions of Windows, 
  OS X, Linux, Solaris or any other operating system with the JRE installed on 
  it, users should be advised that the software has not yet been tested on other 
  platforms, so difficulties may be encountered.</p>
<p>This software was developed with version 1.5 of the JDK (Java Development Kit), 
  so it is suggested that the corresponding version or higher of the JRE be installed 
  on the user's computer.</p>
<p><strong>Installing the Java Runtime Environment</strong></p>
<p>If your system already has the JRE installed, you may skip this  
  section. If not, you will need to install it in order to run
  jMusicMetaManager. The JRE can be downloaded for free from the Java
  web site. The JDK includes the JRE. When the download is complete, 
  follow the installation instructions that come with it. </p>
<p><strong>Installing jMusicMetaManager</strong> </p>
<p>The project can be accessed at <a href="http://jmir.sourceforge.net" target=top>http://jmir.sourceforge.net</a>. This distribution 
  includes a pre-compiled Jar file, the source code and extensive documentation.
  All of this is delivered in a zipped file, from which the project files can be
  extracted.</p>
<p>There are two versions of the project, namely the developer version and the
  user version. The user version contains everything needed to run the project,
  but does not include any source code. The developer version does include
  source code, presented in the form of a NetBeans project.</p>
<p>The user version unzips into a single directory. Installation simply involves 
  copying this directory into any desired location.</p>
<p>The following directories are contained in the developer zip file:</p>
<ul>
  <li> jMusicMetaManager: The jMusicMetaManager project, presented in the form of a 
    NetBeans project. Contains the following directories and files:
    <ul>
      <li>dist: Contains a pre-compiled jMusicMetaManager.jar file (and associated
    	libraries) for direct inclusion in other projects.</li>
      <li>javadoc: Javadoc documentation for the project source code.</li>
      <li>licenses: Licenses associated with the project and its dependencies.</li>
      <li>nbproject: NetBeans project files. This is only relevant to those
    	wishing to use the software in a NetBeans IDE context; it is certainly
    	possible to use the software in other development environments as well.</li>
      <li>ProgramFiles: Files accessed by the software when it is running.</li>
      <li>SampleFiles: Files that can be used to help learn the software.</li>
      <li>src: The project's source code.</li>
      <li>WorkingDirectory: The default directory to save files in.</li>
      <li>build.xml: NetBeans build instructions. Only relevant if using the
    	NetBeans IDE.</li>
      <li>    	 manifest.mf: The manifest used when building the project Jar file.</li>
      <li>Manual.html: The software's manual.</li>
      <li>README.txt: Basic overall documentation of the project.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Third_Party_Jars: Contains the distributable third-party software used by 
    the project. Also includes the jar files for other jMIR projects that this
    project has as adependencies. These need to be included in the jMusicMetaManager
    build (in the NetBeans context, this means adding the jar files found here as 
    libraries).</li>
</ul>
