<pre>public class <span class="typeNameLabel">MIDIIntermediateRepresentations</span>
extends java.lang.Object</pre>
<div class="block">An object of this class is instantiated with a MIDI sequence. The constructor parses this sequence and
 extracts a range of information from it, which is stored in the public fields of this class. The
 information stored in the fields of an object of this class can be useful in calculating a range of
 features.

 <p>After instantiation, an object of this class should simply have its public fields accessed (no changes 
 to these fields should be made). All public methods are simply static convenience classes for interpreting
 information stored in public fields (they should never change values in the public fields). Private methods
 and fields are only used to fill the public fields with values during instantiation, and should not be 
 used in any other context.</p>
 
 <p>It should be noted that this design is messy. Ultimately, each of the public fields of this class should
 be re-implemented as individual MEIFeatureExtractor objects.</p>

 <p><b>Important Notes:</b></p>

 <ul>
 <li>Instrument patches are numbered one unit lower here than in their General MIDI patch names, so 
 remember to raise by one when processing.</li>

 <li>Channels are numbered 1 lower here than in proper MIDI, so, for example, check for Channel 9 when
 actually looking for Channel 10.</li>

 <li>The MIDI data starts at tick 0.</li>

 <li>MIDI sequences that use SMPTE time encoding are not compatible with this software.</li>

<div class="block">A list of data structures, where the outer list contains a separate entry for each MIDI track. The
 inner structure is an array of lists where the array index corresponds to MIDI channel, and each entry
 in the array consists of a list of all melodic intervals that occurred in that channel on that track,
 in the order that they occurred. Each entry in these lists of melodic intervals is an Integer that
 indicates the number of semitones comprising the melodic interval, with positive values indicating
 upwards motion and negative values indicating downwards motion. Any notes on Channel 10 (non-pitched
 percussion) are ignored (i.e. the Channel 10 entry on the array is left empty). It is assumed that
 there is only one melody per channel (if multiple notes occur simultaneously on the same MIDI tick on
 the same MIDI track and channel, then all notes but the first note on that tick are ignored). Other
 than this, all notes on the same track and the same channel are treated as if they are part of a single
 melody. It is also assumed that melodies do not cross MIDI tracks or channels (i.e. that they are each
 separately contained in their own track and channel).</div>
